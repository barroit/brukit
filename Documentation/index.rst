========================
The Brukit Documentation
========================

This is top level of documentation tree. Documents in here are for player, not
end user. I expect you to init your project in documented way. Otherwise, you
fucked up the entire workflow.

I previously called this project utility, but obviously it became framework and
now relies on project barroit_, me, barroit's core library. You need to make
that project exist at same level as brukit, or symlinks die and you can't run
things like scripts/init-repo.sh.
