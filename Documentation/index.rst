========================
The Brukit Documentation
========================

This is top level of documentation tree. Documents in here are for player, not
end user. I expect you to init your project in documented way. Otherwise, you
fucked up the entire workflow.

I previously called this project utility, but obviously it became framework
and now relies on `core library`_. You need to make this library exist at
same level as brukit, or symlinks die and you can't run things like
scripts/init-repo.sh.


.. _`core library`: ../barroit
